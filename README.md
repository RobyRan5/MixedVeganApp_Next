# MixedVeganApp_Next
The idea is to build an app that will assist the good people of Austin in their pursuit for the best vegan food our city has to offer. 

In our app we are hoping to have a map that will display the locations of recommended restaurants, a list of the recommended restaurants, a filter that will toggle the difference between “vegan options only” and “mixed options”. 

We would build the server and API for the restaurants and would not allow users to modify/add locations.

Technology Used:
API-Google Maps
Bootswatch style framework  https://bootswatch.com/journal/
Sequelize
Zeit for Deployment
Server-side APIs
Next.js.
Google-Maps-React
The library includes a helper to wrap around the Google maps API.    
            
The GoogleAPIWrapper High-Order component accepts a configuration                                object which must include an apiKey. If you want to add maps to your app, read about this package.
